# Hadoop template

Thanks to Bordeaux university, this template has been made as a sample basic application meant to be executed on a Hadoop stack. The `jsonnet` part was mostly made out of me unable to bear reading more XML.

## Usage

You shouldn't directly edit `pom.xml` as it is... Hard to read. Instead, edit `pom/pom.jsonnet` and compile it into `pom.xml`. For everything else, Java programmers should feel at home.
